# SECJ-PROGRAMMING-TECHONOLOGY

    Programming techniques are methods for structuring code and solving problems,  encompassing paradigms like Object-
    
    Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming  (FP), structured approaches like top-down design, core skills like debugging & algorithms, and advanced concepts like 
    
    metaprogramming & concurrency, all aimed at writing efficient, maintainable, and robust software. 

    Programming Techonology is one of the course that essential for all the computer science student to learn how to create the coding own like c++,java,python,html,javascript,

    c.Actually, I doesn't like programming since i think need more energy to create coding.However, I must to love it since I choose faculty computer science that this is 
    
    one of my choice in UPU.
