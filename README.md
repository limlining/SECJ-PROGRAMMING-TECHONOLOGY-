# SECJ-PROGRAMMING-TECHONOLOGY

     Programming concepts refer to techniques used in the organization of code and problem-solving. They encompass paradigms such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
     and Functional Programming (FP), structured programming such as Top-Down design, programming fundamentals including debugging and algorithms, and advanced concepts 
     such as metaprograms and concurrency. All the above concepts assist us in creating efficient code that can run reliably.Programming Technology is one of the major 
     courses taken by students studying computer science, as it enlightens us on how to write programs using languages such as C++, Java, Python, HTML, JavaScript, and C.
     First, the course of programming was one that I disliked, as I felt it needed a lot of work to write programs. Nonetheless, I know it is one of the areas I must adapt it 
     since I have opted to study the computer science program, which involves a lot of aspects of programming.
